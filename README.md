## Introduction

As MetaMask Card brings crypto spending to the real world, users need more than just payments — they need a **smart, rewarding experience** built around how and where they spend.

**MetaMiles** is a modular, onchain rewards engine designed to turn every MetaMask Card transaction into meaningful perks, insights, and status. Whether it’s unlocking event tickets, food discounts, or NFT-based merchandise, MetaMiles transforms proof of spend into real-world value.

Built for MetaMask Card users, MetaMiles enables:

 **Spending Analytics** – Track and visualize your card payments with real-time dashboards
 **Tiered Rewards** – Progress through Bronze, Silver, and Gold tiers based on monthly card spend
 **Perk Unlocks** – Get token-gated access to localized drops, discounts, and exclusive events
 **Cross-Chain Flexibility** – Thanks to **LI.FI SDK** and **Circle CCTP**, users can bridge rewards and redeem perks across chains effortlessly

All rewards are claimable via a smooth, gas-efficient onchain flow — and optional **zero-knowledge proofs** ensure users can prove eligibility (e.g., "I spent \$500 this month") **without revealing full payment data**, preserving flexibility and privacy where needed.
