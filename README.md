## Introduction

As MetaMask Card brings crypto spending to the real world, users need more than just payments — they need a **smart, rewarding experience** built around how and where they spend.

**MetaMiles** is a modular, onchain rewards engine designed to turn every MetaMask Card transaction into meaningful perks, insights, and status. Whether it’s unlocking event tickets, food discounts, or NFT-based merchandise, MetaMiles transforms proof of spend into real-world value.

Built for MetaMask Card users, MetaMiles enables:

 **Spending Analytics** – Track and visualize your card payments with real-time dashboards
 **Tiered Rewards** – Progress through Bronze, Silver, and Gold tiers based on monthly card spend
 **Perk Unlocks** – Get token-gated access to localized drops, discounts, and exclusive events
 **Cross-Chain Flexibility** – Thanks to **LI.FI SDK** and **Circle CCTP**, users can bridge rewards and redeem perks across chains effortlessly

All rewards are claimable via a smooth, gas-efficient onchain flow — and optional **zero-knowledge proofs** ensure users can prove eligibility (e.g., "I spent \$500 this month") **without revealing full payment data**, preserving flexibility and privacy where needed.

##  Meet James – Just Another Crypto User... Until MetaMiles

James is your typical Web3 native. He buys NFTs, swaps tokens, earns yield in DeFi. But when it comes to everyday spending — groceries, coffee, concert tickets — it's always the same: money goes out… and that's it.

### Then James Gets the MetaMask Card.

It’s sleek. It connects directly to his MetaMask wallet.
**And with MetaMiles, something amazing happens:**

 **Every swipe becomes a gateway to something more.**

*  James spends \$200 on flight tickets → He unlocks early access to a music festival
* He grabs coffee every morning → MetaMiles gives him discounts at his favorite café
* He shops online for a gift → Boom, he earns exclusive DAO merch

###  And the Best Part?

He never shares private data.
MetaMiles uses **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** — so James can prove he spent over a threshold like **\$500** without showing a single transaction.

 No forms
 No tracking
Just verified, private, onchain proof that unlocks perks

##  One Month Later…

James gets a ping from MetaMiles:

> “You’ve hit **Gold Tier!**
> Claim your bonus airdrop + 25% off your next event ticket.”

He smiles.
For the first time, his everyday spending is **rewarding him in the real world** — without selling his soul to ads, apps, or middlemen.

##  What James Found in MetaMiles:

 **Real-world rewards** for onchain users
**Privacy by default**
**Perks tailored to his lifestyle and location**

A system that speaks Web3 — no banks, no nonsense

Now James tells every crypto friend:

> **“If you’re using MetaMask, and not using the card with MetaMiles…
> you’re literally leaving rewards on the table.”**
